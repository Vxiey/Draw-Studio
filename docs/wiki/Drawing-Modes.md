# Drawing modes and quality

Start with the default or **Balanced / Auto**, then compare a fresh preview after changing one setting.

| Goal | Starting choice | Tradeoff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First attempt | Balanced / Auto | General balance of time and recognizable detail |
| Short drawing round | Extra Fast | Prioritizes shapes and speed; fine details may be omitted |
| More small detail | Pixel Accurate | More planning work and mouse actions; allow extra time |
| Clear simple contours | Quick Sketch | Emphasizes outlines rather than complete shading |

## Extra Fast

Uses connected paths and suitable outline/fill strategies to reduce drawing work. Fill is useful only with supported controls and suitably closed regions; unsafe or unsuitable fills fall back to strokes. It cannot guarantee a complex photo will finish within any chosen timer.

## Pixel Accurate

Prioritizes coverage and detail. Actual results still depend on palette, brush width, planning resolution, target canvas and timing. It is not a guarantee of exact source-pixel reproduction in every drawing app.

## Drawing mode versus quality preset

A quality preset changes the detail/speed balance. **Smart paths**, **Lines** and **Dots** describe how marks are delivered. Smart paths connects nearby pixels to reduce actions; dots can be much slower. Start with Smart paths unless the target needs another method.
