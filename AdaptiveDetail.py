"""Adaptive local-detail planning for Image Draw Bot v1.0.38.

Pure image helpers only: no UI, mouse input, screen capture or native calls.
The engine protects high-contrast edges/local structure while simplifying flat
texture before color planning.  It can also remove tiny horizontal runs only in
areas classified as low detail.
