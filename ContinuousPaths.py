"""Continuous safe-path planner for Draw Studio v1.0.12.

The legacy planner emits one straight mouse stroke for every raster run.  That is
simple and exact, but thousands of press/release boundaries dominate runtime.
This module joins adjacent same-colour horizontal runs only when their pixel
intervals overlap.  Every connector therefore stays inside pixels that already
belong to the same planned colour.

The original ``groups`` are intentionally left unchanged.  Continuous paths are
an execution layer built on top of them, so Fill, colour grouping, GPU planning,
preview maps and old Lines/Dots behaviour remain compatible.
