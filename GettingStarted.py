HELP = {
  "Quality preset": "Start with Balanced or the default. Extra Fast suits short rounds and simple shapes. Pixel Accurate emphasizes detail and can take longer. Build a new preview after changing the preset.",
  "Brush width (px)": "Match the width to the real target tool. A wide brush covers areas faster but can hide small details. A narrow brush preserves edges but needs more strokes. Check the actual mark with a small test.",
  "Rendering style": "Start with Auto. Portrait / shaded suits faces and gradients; Standard / pixel suits flat artwork. Quick Sketch prioritizes recognizable outlines when time is short.",
  "Drawing mode": "Smart paths connects nearby pixels to reduce mouse actions. Lines draws runs; Dots places individual marks and can be much slower. Start with Smart paths.",
  "GPU acceleration": "Auto uses a supported backend when available and falls back to CPU. GPU acceleration helps supported image-processing work; it does not make the target accept unlimited mouse input.",
  "VRAM budget": "Leave Auto initially. A larger budget can help large images but leaves less graphics memory for other apps. More allocated memory is not always faster.",
  "Draw quality": "Higher quality can preserve small features but adds planning work and strokes. Begin with the default; increase quality when a fresh preview loses important details.",
  "Precision": "Higher precision can retain fine edges but usually adds work and strokes. Start with the default and compare a fresh preview.",
  "Speed": "Higher speed only helps when the target app keeps up. If lines have gaps, colors are skipped or controls miss clicks, lower speed and repeat a small test.",
  "Time target": "Choose a budget shorter than the remaining round so setup and finishing have time. A tight budget may omit small details. Check the preview and estimate.",
  "Manual time limit (seconds)": "Leave time for setup and finishing before the round ends. Short budgets can omit small details. Compare estimated time and preview after changes.",
  "Edge behavior": "Controls strokes near the selected canvas boundary. Keep the default at first. If edges are missing, check the real canvas bounds before changing this setting.",
  "Color rendering": "The target may offer fewer colors than the source. Perceptual matching chooses visually similar available colors. Paint custom RGB colors can improve the match, but color switching adds time.",
  "Preview mode": "Build preview calculates a plan without drawing. Rebuild after changing the image, area or settings. The simulation estimates the result; calibration, brush behavior and timing still matter.",
  "CPU workers": "Auto is a good starting point. More workers can help preparation but compete with the target app. A larger number is not always faster.",
  "RAM budget": "Auto balances available memory. Large pictures and detailed plans need more RAM. If preparation struggles, reduce planning resolution rather than allocating all memory.",
  "Planning resolution": "Higher resolution can retain detail but increases memory use, planning time and possible stroke count. Lower it for quicker results or large-image problems.",
  "Fill aggressiveness": "Fill can color closed areas quickly, but an open outline can leak into the background. Start conservatively; verify the target tools and preview before increasing this."
